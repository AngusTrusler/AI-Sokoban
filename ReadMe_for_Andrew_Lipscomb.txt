This was an assignment I completed in my third year at the end of 2019. Included in this file is the university provided task sheet. 

Briefly, I was provided a base game and environment of the sokoban box/target puzzle game(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban). A human playable version is included 'sokoban_map.py', with maps in the 'testcases' folder.

It was my task to program an agent to solve given levels or maps, using different algorithmic and heuristic approaches, and justify them in a final report (also enclosed). 

My final submission 'solver.py' is also enclosed, where it runs a form of the Uniform Cost and A* algorthims. (Line 285-363, 219-232). (I had to update other sections of the code in various other places, these are just the main sections of note.)

Also enclosed are some working drafts I had saved using more basic Breadth-First and Greedy-Best-First search algorithms (bfsworking.py).
